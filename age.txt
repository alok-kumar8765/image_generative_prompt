A hyper-realistic, high-resolution portrait infographic based on the attached photo. 
Keep the same person, identity, hairstyle, clothing and natural skin tone from the attached photo, 
with a neutral studio background.Overlay a subtle, semi-transparent 
facial analysis grid on the entire face, very similar to a 3D face-scanning mesh: thin, 
soft white lines following the facial contours, slightly glowing but not hiding the skin details. 
Add one clean vertical red laser line running down one side of the face, like a futuristic scan. 
All analysis lines must be soft, minimal and elegant, exactly like a cosmetic-tech advertisement.
Create a clean medical–aesthetic infographic that evaluates 5 aging factors using global data 
percentages:1. Fine lines and wrinkles2. Skin texture and elasticity3. Facial volume and 
sagging4. Eye area aging signs5. Skin tone and pigmentationFor each factor, place a small 
label with a thin line pointing to the relevant facial area, and next to it write a short 
title and a realistic percentage score from 0–100% (based on global data), 
for example:“Fine lines & wrinkles – 18%”“Skin texture & elasticity – 72%”“Facial volume & 
sagging – 35%”“Eye area aging signs – 41%”“Skin tone & pigmentation – 63%”Use clean, modern, 
sans-serif typography and small technical-style text, like a scientific facial analysis UI. 
At the bottom of the image, in the center, write a large bold text showing the final 
estimated real age based on the analysis, for example:“ESTIMATED AGE: (random number 
based on face analysis ) ”Overall style: futuristic AI-guided skincare analysis, minimalistic, 
premium editorial lighting, no gender mentioned, suitable for any human face

Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center 
reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

Generate an ultra realistic cinematic mugshot of the man (from attached photo) 
wearing bright orange prison clothes. The photo should be cropped from head to stomach. 
He is holding a prison mugshot board in his both hands. On the board, written with a black marker 
in natural handwriting, it says "Arrested for Posting too much on Facebook". His face should 
resemble the face from the uploaded photo, keeping all details sharp and natural. 
His expression should be serious and dramatic, not happy or laughing. The man should look 
like a mafia-style figure but still handsome. The lighting should look like real prison mugshot lighting, 
harsh and direct, with realistic shadows. The background should be a realistic prison. 8k realistic.

Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center 
reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

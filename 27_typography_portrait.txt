A high-resolution typographic portrait rendered entirely from elegant, handwritten white calligraphy—no illustrations, no solid fills, no photographic elements. 
The subject is a man, depicted in a mid-up body composition, wearing a sharp black three-piece suit, white dress shirt, and a deep burgundy tie. 
His head is turned in a dramatic side profile, gazing off with quiet authority—eyes focused, short beard visible, 
jawline strong—exuding dignified presence and calm power.￼ Every contour of his face, beard, hair, suit lapel, 
and tie is meticulously formed from flowing lines of handwritten text. Depth and structure are conveyed solely through **text density**: dense clusters create shadows along the jaw, 
eye socket, and suit fabric folds; sparse, delicate strokes suggest highlights on the cheekbone, temple, and silk tie. 
The typography is pure white (#FFFFFF), with refined, crisp calligraphic strokes—organic, fluid, and precisely arranged.￼ 
Background is a solid, flat deep dark green (#0B1D1A)—no texture, gradient, or noise. The composition is vertical (9:16), 
minimalist, and editorial in feel, evoking a sophisticated graphic design poster. No extra symbols, blur, or artifacts. 
Style: modern typographic illustration meets high-fashion editorial—where language becomes form, 
and wibawa (dignified authority) is expressed through the rhythm of written words. Ultra-crisp 8K resolution.￼ 
Faithful to the subject’s facial structure and formal attire, transformed entirely into a masterpiece of calligraphic portraiture

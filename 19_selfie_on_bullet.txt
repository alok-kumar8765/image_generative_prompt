An ultra-realistic 8K portrait of a young, wise Middle Eastern descendant sitting on a Royal Enfield bike, tilted slightly to the corner to give it a stylish and moody vibe. 
He leans casually on a bike, wearing a white hoodie-with a Nike logo, wearing a black smartwatch on his wrist. 
He looked straight into the camera with a calm, confident and reflective expression. his hands are empty — he's holding nothing. 
The lighting is dramatic and artistic, using strong, focused studio-style highlights to enhance the face and texture of the clothes. 
Background: a hazy lush green environment with gentle depth of field and soft background leaves, creating a natural and serene atmosphere. 
Overall mood is spiritual, composed, modern, and cinematic. 
Keeping my face 100% same as the reference photo

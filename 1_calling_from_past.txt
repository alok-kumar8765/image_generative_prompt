A chilling horror-thriller movie poster in a dark, psychological tone, composed of five vertical panels. 
At the center stands a man with (attached photo), and wide eyes filled with terror, 
holding an old-fashioned rotary phone to his ear—his mouth slightly agape as if just hearing something horrifying. 
Surrounding him, four panels depict increasingly disturbing alternate versions of the same man: one with a deep gash on his cheek gripping a bloodied knife, 
another with a hollow,￼ lifeless stare, a third drenched in grime and blood, and a fourth with a cold, 
merciless expression wielding a rusty machete. The entire composition uses a desaturated palette of deep browns, 
ashen blues, and blacks, with dramatic top-down lighting casting sharp, oppressive shadows that amplify the claustrophobic dread. 
At the top of the poster, the title **“CALL FROM THE PAST”** appears in a bold, 
distressed sans-serif font reminiscent of 1990s–2000s thriller posters￼ (similar to Impact or Bebas Neue)—thick, uneven, 
with subtle blood smears and a faint drop shadow. Just below, the tagline reads: **“ONCE A SERIAL KILLER CALLS... HE’LL START HUNTING YOUR PAST”**, 
set in a sharp, elegant serif typeface like Cinzel or Garamond, rendered in pale white or faded cream with a slight film grain texture and soft blur for a vintage cinematic feel. 
The overall visual style is ultra-realistic and filmic, featuring skin pores, blood texture, fabric detail,￼ and a subtle film grain overlay with soft vignetting—evoking the raw, 
analog aesthetic of classic psychological horror posters with no modern elements.￼

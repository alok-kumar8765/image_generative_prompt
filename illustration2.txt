​"A detailed super-realistic mixed media illustration of a graceful young Asian woman with long wavy black hair and a soft yet piercing gaze. Combining fine white, yellow, and gold line art with wet-on-wet watercolor shading and soft, smooth overlays of watercolor and oil paint. The style features a high-contrast dark background filled with faint architectural blueprints, messy scribbles, and handwritten notes reading 'Amidst the noise of the world, your love is the most melodious silence. Simple, yet perfecting time,' in a vintage super-realistic style. Behind the subject, large, fine swirling ornamental lines almost fill the upper section, emerging from dark smoke that occupies the mid-to-upper area (featuring blue, purple, pink, and cream elements), with some colors glowing to draw attention. Use subtle splatters of gold leaf and yellow ink. Rough, sophisticated, Da Vinci sketch meets modern graphic novel."

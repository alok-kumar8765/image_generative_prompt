# BOOK LIFTING
# ==============

A hyper-realistic, 8k, medium full shot captured with a standard lens at eye-level, 
showcasing a forced perspective scene with cinematic lighting. In the extreme foreground, 
a human hand with red nail polish holds a significantly oversized, thick copy of 
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," its worn orange and blue spine facing the camera, 
creating the illusion of immense scale. Directly beneath this colossal book, a man, 
uploaded face as reference, with a short beard and mustache, is posed in a kneeling squat. 
He wears a dark olive green crew-neck t-shirt, ripped black skinny jeans with holes at both knees,
 and dark sneakers with white soles. His muscular arms are flexed and raised high above his head, 
 palms facing upwards, positioned precisely to appear as if he is straining to support the book's weight. 
 The background consists of a plain, light off-white wall, meeting a light brown wooden floor 
 with visible grain running horizontally. The scene is illuminated by soft, even frontal lighting, 
 casting subtle shadows and highlighting the highly detailed textures of the book, clothing, and skin, 
 with sharp focus throughout.
 Man face should be 100 percent same as in reference photo.
Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

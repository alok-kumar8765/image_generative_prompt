 Transform the uploaded photo into an elegant, 
 culturally rich royal portrait—keeping every person’s real face, skin tone, features, age, 
 and natural expression EXACTLY the same. Do not beautify or alter their identity. 
 Only enhance the environment, styling, and lighting. 
 Art Direction — Choose Automatically Based on Mood: – Mughal Durbar: carved sandstone pillars, jharokhas, 
 intricate floral motifs, inlay work – Rajputana Palace: grand arches, pastel sandstone walls, 
 jharokha balconies, carved marble jaalis – Nawabi Lucknow: perfume-lit courtyards, 
 chikankari drapes, soft white marble, 
 subtle Awadhi sophistication Overall Look: – warm, golden, soft royal lighting – oil-painting 
 visual texture (not too glossy) – gentle painterly brush strokes on clothes & background – subtle depth, 
 misty ambience, nostalgic elegance Wardrobe Preservation: – keep the 
 original sherwani / bandhgala / kurta exactly as in the photo – enhance it with fine embroidery highlights, 
 richer textile texture, and royal sheen – DO NOT change silhouette, color palette, 
 or design details unless needed to match lighting Pose Guidelines: – keep the user’s original 
 pose as-is (no changes) – but frame them like a royal portrait: waist-up or 
 full-body depending on source image – add natural diffusion and depth behind the 
 subject Background: Create a refined, atmospheric royal setting behind them 
 with: – palatial arches, carved pillars, Mughal–Rajput blend – soft sunlight 
 filtering through jaali patterns – muted golds, sandstone, emerald, 
 ivory tones – rich but tasteful ambience, not overly dramatic 
 Final Finish: – high-end regal portrait – warm royal glow – subtle 
 oil texture – grounded cultural authenticity – still looks like a real photo, not fantasy.

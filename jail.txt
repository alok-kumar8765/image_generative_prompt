Take this photo without altering the face in the slightest.
This realistic close-up portrait of a tattooed man smoking a cigarette, 
his hands cuffed, was taken from a distance of approximately 0.8–1 meter with a 50mm lens. 
His facial expression is serious and calm, and his messy black hair falls to his forehead. 
A thin wisp of cigarette smoke rises in front of his face, creating a dramatic effect. 
The man is wearing an orange prison uniform with a rumpled white collar. 
Tattoos cover his arms, fingers, and neck, clearly visible and contrasting.
The background is a large, dull, greenish-gray tile wall, creating a cold and cramped atmosphere. 
Low-key lighting, coming from a single direction in the upper left, creates sharp shadows on 
the sides of the face and hands, highlighting the texture of the skin, tattoos, and metallic handcuffs. 
The overall tone is dark, gritty, and intense, with a mysterious and criminal atmosphere. 
The color tones tend to be muted with a shallow depth of field, resulting in a blurred background 
and a strong focus on the face and hand holding the cigarette.*
Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

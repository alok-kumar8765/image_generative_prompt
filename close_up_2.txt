Use my photo uploaded (keep original face) A hyper-realistic, 8k, 
full-body portrait captured with a 35mm lens, featuring a male subject standing centrally in an urban alleyway. 
The camera is positioned at eye-level, providing a direct and engaging perspective. 
The lighting is natural and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, 
casting soft shadows that highlight the textures of the clothing and environment. 
The subject, with an athletic build and short, styled hair their face is "uploaded face 100% as reference". 
They are wearing a pristine white hoodie and matching sweatpants set. 
The hoodie features a striking split design: the wearer's left side displays a distressed graphic 
of purple and blue "X O" eyes and jagged teeth, while the wearer's right side is covered in a vibrant, 
distressed green, blue, and purple splatter pattern over a black base, featuring a white "X" eye and jagged teeth. 
This split graphic continues down the matching sweatpants, 
with a smaller purple/blue "X O" graphic on the wearer's left hip and the green/blue/purple splatter 
pattern over black with a white "X" eye and jagged teeth on the wearer's right hip, creating a 
cohesive and dynamic visual flow. The subject's hands are casually placed in the pockets of the sweatpants, 
and they are wearing clean white athletic sneakers. The background consists of narrow, 
slightly blurred brick and concrete buildings flanking the alley, with a damp, textured pavement underfoot, 
adding to the gritty urban aesthetic. The overall image boasts cinematic lighting and highly detailed textures, 
emphasizing the fabric and the intricate graphic design.
Add a typography named "Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL"  With glowing neon blue color in a small but readable font, 
in the bottom-center.

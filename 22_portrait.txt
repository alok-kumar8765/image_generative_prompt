A man, wearing a navy blue plaid hem, black cargo pants, and black and white high-tops. He is holding a white coffee cup and leaning against a black frame of glass door. 
On the door is written "THE BARUNG CAFE - COFFEE & PASTRIES" in white letters. Behind the glass there is a little blurred cafe interior and someone looks inside. 
The natural lighting of daytime brightens the atmosphere. Use 100% of the face and reference from the photos I posted.

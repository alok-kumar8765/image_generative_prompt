Create an ultra-realistic portrait using the uploaded photos, 
keeping my face perfectly accurate with no changes to structure or expression.
I’m standing in a modern studio, leaning casually against a large white 
sculptural installation of the text “ALOK KUMAR” arranged vertically, 
with each letter stacked upward like a tall architectural totem. 
The sculpture is the same height as me so the composition feels balanced and powerful. 
I’m leaning one shoulder lightly against the vertical “ALOK KUMAR” structure.
My body faces slightly to the side with most of my weight resting on one leg in a relaxed, 
confident stance. Both hands rest comfortably inside my cargo pockets. 
My head tilts a little as I look calmly toward the camera, 
with messy natural hair that keeps my thoughtful look from the reference.
I’m wearing an oversized black t-shirt made of soft cotton with COMPANY logo. 
I’ve paired it with black cargo pants and clean white and red sneakers with visible laces and defined soles.
The style is minimalist streetwear with a monochrome palette.
The shot is taken from a low angle to boost presence and make the vertical ALOK KUMAR sculpture 
feel bold and architectural beside me.
Lighting is controlled and directional, creating soft shadows across the sculpture and subtle highlights on my face and outfit. 
The backdrop is a clean dark grey studio background with crisp white details.
The camera look matches an 85mm portrait lens for cinematic depth, gentle compression, and natural proportions.
The final mood is modern, editorial, and confident, blending streetwear presence with 
architectural design in a striking low-angle portrait.
Add a typography named "Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL"  With glowing neon blue color in a small but readable font, 
in the bottom-center.

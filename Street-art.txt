PROMPT 

Create a grungy, 3D embossed style realistic black and white close-up face portrait of person from uploaded photo. The image must be constructed as a chaotic collage using torn fragments of realistic vintage newspaper clippings, old advertisements with visible halftone dot patterns, and distressed paper textures. The color palette is black and white, applied in heavy, overlapping layers that define his face and hair. Add dynamic elements like aggressive ink splatters, spray paint drips, and stencil artifacts across the entire composition. Text fragments from the newspapers (like their famous song title or their quote) should be legible within the colored sections. The background is vintage newspaper clippings. The overall feel should be raw, textured, and rebellious street art. Image ratio 3:4.

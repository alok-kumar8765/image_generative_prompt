Use my uploaded photos as face reference. Create a half-body portrait of a man, framed by dark wooden window sills, 
with soft lighting and a moody atmosphere. Background: thick green foliage very blurred (bokeh), high contrast. 
Foreground: green leaves that are out-of-focus to give depth. Style: romantic and stylish, man leans casually out of the window, a natural expression. 
Aesthetic: serene, earthy, cinematic.

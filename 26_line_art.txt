Create an extremely intricate line art portrait in the style of fine etching, woodcut, or linocut — every contour, shadow, and texture rendered through flowing, 
swirling, hand-carved linework. The entire image should feel like ink pressed onto aged, textured paper: visible grain, subtle imperfections, faint creases, 
and organic blemishes enhance its tactile, vintage quality.￼
Use a muted, vintage-toned color palette: deep navy blue for shadows and depth, brick red / terracotta for warmth and accents, faded gold or cream for highlights, 
and ivory white for soft transitions and negative space. Colors are applied sparingly, as if hand-colored over a monochrome base, never overpowering the linework.
The subject is a man in a sharp black suit and tie, captured in a mid-up shot — framed from just below his chest upward, with dramatic lighting focused on his face.￼
His expression is intense, contemplative, or subtly commanding — eyes piercing, jawline defined by precise linework. His hair is neatly styled,
merging seamlessly into the background’s swirling patterns — becoming one with ethereal clouds, hidden vines, or abstract cosmic swirls.
Embed subtle fantasy elements within the composition: tiny winged creatures clinging to his lapel, celestial symbols woven into his tie’s knot, 
or ghostly faces emerging from the folds of his jacket —￼ all rendered in the same delicate linework, barely noticeable at first glance.
The background is dense yet harmonious — layered with organic, rhythmic swirls that echo the movement of his collar, lapels, and hair. No flat areas; every surface is alive with detail. 
The overall mood is dreamlike, mysterious, and timeless — like a forgotten folio from a 19th-century occult grimoire or a lost noir-fantasy manuscript.￼ 
Style: Hyper-detailed, illustrative, with strong contrast between ink-black lines and soft, restrained color washes. Slight vignette and paper texture overlay to enhance antiquity. 
Lighting is cinematic — spotlight effect from above and slightly in front, casting subtle shadows under his chin and cheekbones,
while keeping his eyes illuminated with quiet intensity.￼

A highly detailed portrait, 100% identical to the uploaded reference photo, 
featuring an artistic face composed entirely of evenly repeated directional and cross-hatched lines.

The background is a very dark, textured brown surface with strong contrast. 
The subject is wearing the exact same clothing as in the reference photo. 
If the reference photo shows the subject wearing a hijab, the final result must also accurately retain and depict the hijab. 
Sharp focus, pen-and-ink illustration style, clinical precision, and realistic topographic skin detailing.

Create a captivating black and white portrait, captured from a slightly low angle, focuses on a circular mirror held by unseen hands with long black nails in the foreground. 
The mirror reflects a woman with an intense, gaze, her head slightly tilted. She has sharp, defined features, prominent cheekbones, and dark, perhaps pulled-back, hair. 
She wears simple, dark earrings and a dark, high-necked garment with subtle lace or textured detailing around the collar. 
The reflection in the mirror is crisp and well-lit, highlighting the contours of her face.
The background, seen both directly around the mirror and in the periphery, is a softly blurred, natural outdoor setting – possibly a forest or field with tall, 
slender trees or sparse vegetation, rendered in shades of grey. The bokeh is smooth and painterly, 
creating a sense of depth and isolating the subject in the mirror.
The overall mood is contemplative and slightly dramatic, emphasizing light and shadow to sculpt the woman's face and create a timeless, artistic feel. 
The lighting appears soft but directional, highlighting one side of her face more than the other. 
The image possesses a fine art photography quality, with excellent tonal range and subtle grain if desired, evoking a classic, enigmatic portrait. Do not change my face.

A nostalgic, grainy 1980s analog photograph captures a moment of quiet artistic contemplation, imbued with a warm, slightly melancholic aura. Shot on Kodak Gold 400 film, the image features visible, organic film grain throughout, with a soft, dreamy focus and slight light leaks subtly framing the edges. The scene is illuminated by harsh, direct 1980s flash photography, creating a distinct bloom and slight red-eye effect while intensely harsh lighting illuminates the subject's skin. The woman, holding a mug of hot coffee, smoke steaming from the mug with a stack of chunky silver bangles on her wrist, is paused in a thoughtful, downward gaze, her pose echoing the original but immersed in a distinct 80s world. She wears an oversized, boxy rayon-blend blazer in a muted teal with exaggerated shoulder pads over a soft, V-neck blouse in a complementary dusty rose, paired with high-waisted, pleated gabardine trousers that taper at the ankle. Her makeup features softly applied brown eyeshadow that subtly defines her eyes, a gentle sweep of rosy peach blush across her cheekbones, and natural-looking lipstick in a muted rose tone with a satin finish, all set against a subtle, matte foundation. Her voluminous, shoulder-length brunette hair is expertly teased at the crown and styled with soft, feathery waves, held in place with a visible sheen of hairspray, some face-framing layers softly curled around her temple. She accessorizes with large, ornate gold clip-on earrings. The background reveals a wood-paneled wall with visible grain, adorned with a mix of abstract art prints in geometric shapes and a bulky beige landline phone on a nearby lacquered side table, all bathed in a color palette of warm earth tones, muted pastels, and a pop of teal. The overall aesthetic is that of a digital camera from the year 2000, with a distinct Y2K photo look, covered in a layer of dust and fine scratches, giving it an aged, vintage appearance as if it has been stored for a long time.

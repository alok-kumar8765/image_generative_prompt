# ===============

Scene Overview:

A wide grey wall with subtle 3D carved wood texture.

Mounted on the wall is a framed hyper-realistic 3D wood relief artwork.

On the right side stands a full-body, super-realistic real man, leaning sideways with his back and right shoulder against the framed artwork.

Visual Twist:

The real man and the wooden relief visually merge, as if they are two material versions of the same person.

Subject: The same man as in the uploaded photo reference

Critical Details (Exact Match):

The carved face is a perfect 1:1 match with the uploaded photo — all features, expression, beard, and hairstyle identical

Hairstyle exactly as in the photo: well-groomed, modern, slightly long in the middle

Wooden upper torso aligns exactly with the real man’s pose

Wood carving continues seamlessly into the real man’s body

Every detail of the face, including jawline, eyebrows, nose, lips, and eyes, must precisely match the reference

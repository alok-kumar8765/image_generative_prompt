A collage of complex mixed media street art mural. This composition features close up and 
fragmented photorealistic elements with wild and spontaneous semi-abstract, 
such as full color faces (using attached photos made 1000000% the same), 
attached photo faces are partially formed from a collage of scrap pieces with color 
matching the original photo, blended with bold graphic design and patterns date. 
These patterns are created decorative semi-realistic with highly textured oil paints, 
ranging from stylish wave image abstractions, leaf abatraximotives, 
cloud motif abstractions and impressionist forms in earth colours such as light brown, 
dark red, beige and brownish yellow. the pattern patterns are made with inconsistent 
gradient colors, partially fused with facial image. This artwork integrates wildly 
styled handwritten typography with the words "DON'T FORGET TO DESPERATE", "LIVE IS LIKE DIE IS NOT VERY" 
also some handwritten love poems are ubiquitous, and 
spontaneous handwritten character numbers "62812", "3033", 
and "8773" , along with a collage of torn not tidy newspaper 
and magazines in the form of symbolic images like colored dragons, 
full color loreng tiger. and the big Taurus symbol of earth color. 
The overall aesthetic is a mix of oil paint, stencil technique, 
and graphic illustration combined with pasting technique applied to dark colored textured canvas. 
Visual arrangement of finishing by giving paint colors (yellow, green, red) overlapping abstractly, 
the impression that paint is rubbed with origin, loose and spontaneity. 
Overall the color was done a little darker on the edges and sharp overall.

Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center 
reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

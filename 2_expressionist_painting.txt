A stunning digital expressionist painting, created with 100% likeness to the attached photo model. 
It combines textured brushstrokes and visible edges with stylized realism. 
The main focus is dramatic dual lighting: a strong warm orange light illuminates one side of the subject, 
creating bright highlights and deep shadows, while a cool blue light illuminates the opposite side, resulting in rich color contrast. 
The colors are applied boldly in blocks and directional strokes. The background is abstract and minimalist, 
composed of loose sketches, rough lines, and fragmented paint strokes in white, grey, and blue, giving an unfinished and artistic impression. 
The overall atmosphere is moody, modern, and rich with visual texture

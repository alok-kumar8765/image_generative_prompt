An ultra-realistic cinematic 8K portrait photo of a man using my face as a primary reference (100% the same, without any change in face, eyes, nose, jaw, or basic expressions).
The subject sits casually on the studio floor with one foot bent and one foot straightened, position facing the camera. The right hand points directly towards the camera, a friendly expression, confident and optimistic, with a natural smile.

Small geometric graphic elements float in the air to give a futuristic effect

Subtle shadow and realistic depth
Sharp focus on face and hands, background a little blur (bokeh)

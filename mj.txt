Use the uploaded photo as the primary and only face reference.
Preserve my exact facial identity — same facial structure, proportions,
jawline, nose, eyes, lips, and overall face shape.
My face must be clear, sharp, realistic, and immediately recognizable.
Do NOT beautify, replace, or alter my facial identity.
Hairstyle: modern, cool, realistic hairstyle suitable for a male.

A lone male dancer inspired by Michael Jackson, captured mid-pose in a dark, 
empty stage, head tilted down, one leg crossed gracefully, hands in pockets. 
He wears a loose white silk shirt with an open collar and tailored white trousers, 
softly flowing with motion. Electric blue ethereal energy and smoky aura surround his body, 
glowing like lightning and mist, outlining his silhouette. 
His curly hair falls naturally over his face, creating a mysterious, 
emotional mood. Dramatic low-key lighting with a cool blue color palette, 
deep shadows, subtle rim light, and cinematic contrast. Ultra-realistic digital painting, 
hyper-detailed fabric texture, volumetric smoke, glowing particles, smooth gradients, 
dark minimal background, 4K, masterpiece, cinematic poster style, fine art realism.

Add my name “Poster Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” as a small, clean watermark in the bottom-right corner.
Text style: minimal, modern, semi-transparent, white or light gray.
Do not overlap the face or body, do not distract from the artwork.

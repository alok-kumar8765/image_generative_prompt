Take this photo without distorting the face at all.
This realistic indoor lifestyle photo features a young man reclining casually on a dark green velvet sofa, shot from a slightly higher angle at a medium distance (approximately 1.5–2 meters). The subject is positioned diagonally across the frame, holding an olive green electric guitar resting across his body, with one hand loosely resting on the fretboard. He is wearing a casual long-sleeved shirt with a block of white, blue, and yellow, paired with light yellow shorts. A pair of black headphones are around his neck, adding to the relaxed and creative atmosphere.
The background features a textured beige carpeted floor, dotted with stacks of paperback books and vinyl records placed naturally around the sofa, suggesting a private and artistic living space. Some books are stacked neatly while others are open or slightly tilted, enhancing the realism. A vinyl record with a visible label sits near the foreground, partially overlapping the books.

The lighting is soft, warm, and diffused, resembling natural light coming in from a side window, creating soft shadows and subtle highlights on the subject's face, the guitar body, and the texture of the fabric. There's no harsh contrast, maintaining a balance of lighting and natural skin tones.
The overall color palette is subdued and earthy, dominated by greens, creams, yellows, and soft blues. The depth of field is moderate, keeping the subject sharply focused while the surrounding objects remain slightly subdued but still recognizable.
The atmosphere is calm, intimate, and introspective, conveying a sense of relaxation, creativity, and serene solitude. The image feels honest and uncontrived, with a realistic lifestyle editorial aesthetic, highly detailed textures, natural proportions, and authentic lighting.

Take this photo without changing your face at all.
A young man sits casually on an industrial-style metal drum, holding a basketball in one hand, wearing an oversized black-and-white sports jersey, dark jeans, white-and-black sneakers, and glasses. The pose is relaxed yet confident, with his body leaning slightly forward, his gaze directed directly at the camera with a calm and cool expression.
Shooting Distance & Angle:
Medium full-body shot, camera approximately 1–1.5 meters from the subject, eye-level angle slightly tilted downwards for an intimate yet powerful feel, and a vertical composition.
Background:
An industrial-patterned brick and metal wall with various brightly colored neon signs (heart, fire, hand, headphone, camera, Korean and Japanese symbols), arranged randomly yet artistically. The neon elements give a modern urban, cyberpunk, and street culture feel. The floor and surrounding props include metal, neon-lit electrical cables, and a graffiti-covered drum.
Lighting:
Low-light studio lighting with blue, purple, pink, and cyan neon lights as practical lighting. A soft key light from the left side illuminates the subject's face and body, while a neon rim light from behind separates the subject from the background. The shadows are subtle yet high-contrast. Neon reflections are clearly visible on the floor and metal surfaces.
Ambiance & Mood:
Urban, modern, edgy, and street-style with a touch of cyberpunk. The nighttime atmosphere is energetic yet stylish, feeling like a fashion editorial or creative portrait shoot in a neon-themed studio. Colors are high-contrast, strongly saturated, yet realistic and sharp.
Visual & Technical Style:
Realistic photography, high detail, sharp focus, light shallow depth of field (slight background blur), 35mm or 50mm lens, aperture around f/1.8–f/2.8, medium ISO, cinematic neon color grading, professional quality, ultra-high resolution.

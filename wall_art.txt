Take this photo without changing the face at all.
This is a full-length shot of a young man standing casually with his arms crossed in front of a large, 
brightly colored mural depicting the man's stylized face. The mural features bold teal, 
orange, and navy colors with strong graphic shapes and shadows. 
The man is wearing a light blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, 
paired with white cargo pants and black and white sneakers. 
His posture is relaxed, with one foot slightly forward, leaning lightly against the low wall in front of him.
Camera Distance:
– Shot taken from a distance of 1-2 meters, full-body framing, eye-level angle.
Lighting:
– Natural outdoor sunlight, soft golden hour tones.
– Light coming from the front left, creating soft shadows on the subject's face and a faint shadow on the ground.
– Even lighting on the mural behind him.
Background:
– Large wall mural depicting the man's stylized portrait with bold contrasting colors (orange, teal, navy).
– Smooth concrete surface at the bottom.
– Clean urban outdoor setting.
Ambiance & Mood:
– Modern, artistic, and stylish urban feel.
– Calm, confident, and relaxed energy.
– Sharp colors with high clarity and realistic textures.
Style & Technical Notes:
– High-resolution realism.
– Shallow-medium depth of field, the mural remains crisp and detailed.
– Balanced color gradation with warm sunlight and saturated tones of the mural.
– Slight vignette to focus attention on the subject.
Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

Take this photo without changing the face at all.

An adult man sits cross-legged on the wooden floor of a 1980s-style living room, shot from a medium distance, about 1–1.5 meters from the subject, with the camera angled straight ahead at eye level. The composition is symmetrical, with the subject centered in the frame. He wears a white and black raglan shirt with red lettering and blue jeans, white sneakers, and a calm expression on his face, looking directly into the camera.

In the background, there's a dull brown vintage-patterned fabric sofa, a wooden bookshelf on the left side neatly stacked with old books, and a warm yellow table lamp with a soft glow. The background wall is a pale gray with large, hand-painted letters "HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026", adorned with small, colorful decorative lights (red, green, yellow, and blue) that glow dimly and unevenly, creating a mysterious impression.

In the foreground at the bottom of the frame, the wooden floor appears to be cracked, forming a blue-white glowing portal, emitting a cool glow and subtle electrical effects, contrasting with the room's warm lighting. The light from the portal subtly underlights the subject's lower body.

The lighting uses a combination of:

Soft, warm key light from the left table lamp

Low ambient light throughout the room

Cool accent light from a portal in the floor creates a realistic and cinematic contrast of warm versus cool colors.

The tone and atmosphere feel tense, mysterious, and supernatural, yet still realistic, like a scene from a sci-fi drama film. The overall color is desaturated, with minimal film grain, and a medium depth of field (f/2.8 – f/4) so ​​the background is still clearly visible while maintaining focus on the subject. The visual style is cinematic realism, high detail, natural skin tones, soft shadows, and no overprocessing.

Create this photo without altering the face in the slightest.
This dramatic portrait of a young, athletic man stands firmly in the center of the frame, 
the camera approximately 1.5 meters from the subject, using a 50mm lens for realistic depth. 
The camera is at eye-level, sharply focused on the man's face, which gazes intently into the camera. 
He is wearing a white t-shirt that is ripped in several areas of the chest and abdomen, 
revealing the worn and slightly dirty texture of the fabric.
The man holds a lit match in front of his chest, providing a small but highly contrasting light 
source in the darkness. The matchlight creates warm highlights on his face and hands, 
as well as soft reflections on his front. Surrounding him are numerous mysterious, 
pale-skinned hands emerging from the darkness, reaching out and reaching for him from various 
angles—hands behind his shoulders, near his waist, to the left and right, and from below the frame.
The background is a dark room filled with a thin haze of smoke, providing a dramatic atmospheric 
effect. The haze is slightly illuminated by the matchlight, creating visual depth and a vague 
silhouette. The main lighting is minimal, with only dim ambient light from above casting deep 
shadows on his shoulders, jaw, and arm muscles.
The overall feel is tense, mysterious, and cinematic, a blend of human realism and surreal 
horror elements. The cool, bluish tones of the background contrast with the warm colors of the fire, 
creating an intense and menacing mood. The depth of field is narrow, focusing only on the man and 
the hands closest to him, while the fog and background fade naturally.
Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

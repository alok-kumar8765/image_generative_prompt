Take this photo without changing the face at all.
An adult man stands full-length in the middle of a school parking lot at night after rain, in a full-body shot from a distance of approximately 1–1.5 meters, with the camera at eye-level. The subject is wearing a white, 3/4-sleeved baseball shirt with red lettering, light blue jeans rolled up at the bottom, and black canvas shoes. He carries a denim jacket in one hand, a spiked wooden bat touching the wet asphalt, while the other holds a walkie-talkie near his face. His facial expression is tense and alert, his gaze directed to the side as if he were listening for something dangerous.
The background, a brick school building with a sign above the entrance, is clearly visible but slightly blurred due to the medium depth of field (f/2.8–f/4). In the distance, the silhouette of a dark humanoid creature stands on the roof of the building, its shape vague and ominous. The night sky is filled with thick storm clouds with forked lightning bolts that dramatically illuminate the sky. High-contrast cinematic lighting:
The main light comes from a bluish lightning flash from behind (strong backlight), creating a rim light around the edge of the subject's body.
The additional soft red light from the left side (simulating emergency lights or city lights) creates a sense of menace.
The light reflections are clearly visible on the wet asphalt surface, adding to the realistic feel.
Mood & Atmosphere: Tense, dark, full of danger, a cinematic horror-sci-fi atmosphere, a sense of confrontation before a fight. The dominant colors are cool blue and dramatic red, teal-red color grading, high contrast yet still realistic, sharp details, and the textures of skin and fabric are clearly visible.
Visual Style: Realistic cinematic photography, ultra-detailed, high dynamic range, shallow depth of field, light, full-frame camera quality, 35mm lens, cinematic night photography, moody atmosphere.

"Real, ethereal portrait of a person in a photo (made 100% the same), the person and the background are composed of swirling liquid fluid patterns. The style is a mixture of liquid marble and psychedelic art. Bright beautiful colors: pastel orange, teal, pink and purple. Intricate flowing curves, shiny textures, soft lighting, 8k resolution, stunning abstract realism, between the object and the background is only differentiated because of the shadows and the depth of the volume. No black... all colors candy. The 3D appearance is shiny and feels smooth"

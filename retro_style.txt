Create a 4×4 grid of 16 images, starting with 1900, progressing by decade (1900, 1910, … up to 2050 if needed).

In each section:

The subject is exactly like the uploaded photo reference — same face, facial features, and expression.

Style the subject according to that decade, including:

Clothing

Hairstyle

Facial hair (if applicable)

Accessories (hats, glasses, jewelry, etc.)

# ===========
# Retro Look
# ===========

Color palettes appropriate to the decade
Backgrounds reflective of the era
Add a small text label with the year in the corner of each section (e.g., “1900”, “1910”, etc.).
Visual Consistency:
All images must maintain your facial identity exactly.
No distortion or stylization of your face.
Ensure realistic proportion and natural pose for each decade’s style.
Typography Watermark:
Bottom-center of the full grid: "Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL"
Small but readable
Neon orange glowing text with soft outer glow
MS-Office-style smooth Blue → Green gradient outer stroke
Luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork
Additional Notes:
Ensure color, lighting, and background reflect each decade authentically.
Each grid cell should clearly convey the decade’s era while keeping your face recognizable across all images.

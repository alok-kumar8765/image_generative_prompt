Studio-style hyper-realistic photography portrait featuring a young man using 100% of the face from the reference photo I uploaded (face must be identical, cannot be changed). 
Guy stands casual and leans with one arm on a giant 3D letter written "WELCOME 2026".
The “WELCOME 2026” text is very large, thick, and solid with modern sans-serif typography. 
The inside of each letter is filled with the panorama of Yogyakarta (Jogja) from afternoon to night, featuring iconic landmarks such as Jogja Monument, 
Malioboro, Yogyakarta Keraton, the city's typical street lights, and a warm cultural city atmosphere. The city lights look vivid and realistic, blending naturally with the letter shapes.
A doff-green blue lettering exterior, with smooth edges, soft reflections, and realistic shadows falling onto the studio floor.
Man standing on the right side of the text, one leg slightly bent and crossed casually. 
He's wearing a soft peach/salmon hoodie, light beige chino pants, and dark brown sandals. 
One hand is in the pants pocket, the other hand is focused on the letter "WELCOME".
Calm, friendly and confident facial expressions. Neatly styled black hair modern style,
Plain light gray minimalist studio background, clean without distractions, with soft and even professional studio lighting. Natural shading adds depth and a realistic effect.
Cinematic high-key lighting using softbox from front and side, accurate colors, clear hoodie fabric details, face details and very sharp 3D letters.
Full body composition, eye-level camera, balanced framing between subject and text.

Use my uploaded photo as a strict facial identity reference. 
The generated face must match my uploaded photo as closely as 
possible — same facial structure, jawline, eyes, nose, lips, 
skin tone, and overall identity. Do not stylize, idealize, or alter the face. 
Face accuracy is the highest priority.
Create an ultra-photorealistic full-body image of me, height 5 feet 6 inches, 
masculine ,  fit , slim, naturally athletic body, flat chest, abs and bisecps,  realistic human proportions.
The scene is a realistic New York small street, narrow urban road with brick buildings, 
fire escapes, street signs, debris, and realistic city textures.
I am walking forward naturally, body relaxed but powerful, 
while looking up at the sky with a serious, focused expression.
In the sky above, a large alien spaceship is actively attacking the city. 
The ship emits a powerful high-energy beam striking a nearby building. 
One building is partially collapsing, with concrete breaking, windows shattering, 
smoke, dust, and ashes floating in the air. The destruction looks physically realistic, 
cinematic, and believable — not exaggerated or comic-style.
Appearance & Action:
Hair is stylish, modern, and well-groomed, realistic texture
Wearing a realistic formal suit (jacket, shirt underneath)
With my left hand, I am removing simple half frame transparent goggles from my face,
With my right hand, I am pulling open my suit shirt's button.
The top 3 buttons of the shirt are open, revealing a black and red Superman-style suit underneath
The inner suit looks textured, fabric-based, realistic, tight but believable, not glossy or cartoonish
The Superman suit reveal is subtle and realistic — like a cinematic live-action moment, not a comic panel.
Lighting:
Natural daylight mixed with cinematic contrast from explosions and alien beam glow. 
Realistic shadows, depth of field, volumetric smoke, and accurate reflections on skin and clothing.
Overall Style:
100% photorealistic, live-action movie still, DSLR photography look, ultra-high detail, 
sharp focus, natural skin texture, realistic motion, cinematic realism, 8K quality.
Absolutely no illustration or comic styling.
Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center 
reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.

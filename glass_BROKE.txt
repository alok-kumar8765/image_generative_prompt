Take this photo without changing the face at all.
This ultra-realistic portrait of a muscular man wearing a plain white shirt 
standing behind a cracked glass panel covered in water droplets. 
The camera is positioned about 1 meter in front of the subject, 
using a 50mm lens for a close-up shot from head to waist.
The subject presses both palms against the cracked glass in front of him, 
making the crack lines appear sharp and dramatic. His skin is wet, 
reflecting the soft light, making the muscle texture and contours of 
his body appear clear and realistic. His dark hair also appears wet and messy, 
falling across his forehead.
The background features an industrial metal staircase with a rough texture, dark color, 
and strong structural elements. The left side of the background is 
filled with neon red light reflecting off the stairwell walls, while the right side 
is filled with cool blue-green light, providing a dramatic color contrast.
The lighting uses a combination of soft key light from the front to illuminate the 
face and muscles, plus red and blue backlighting from the left and right sides to 
create a cinematic and intense atmosphere. The water on the glass reflects the light, 
making it appear glistening.
The atmosphere is cold, tense, and dramatic, like a scene from an action or thriller film. 
The tone is dark yet full of contrasting neon colors, creating an urban, industrial, and slightly futuristic atmosphere.
The rendering of skin textures, moisture, glass refraction, deep shadows, and sharp highlights is remarkably realistic.
The 9:16 aspect ratio offers cinematic photography with high detail.
Add subtle typography watermark at the bottom-center reading: “Created By : ALOK KUMAR KAUSHAL” — small but readable, 
neon orange glowing text with a soft outer glow. Apply an MS-Office-style outer border stroke 
using a smooth Blue → Green gradient, luminous, clean, modern, not overpowering the artwork.
